# claude-wrapper.sh — launch Claude Code with mux0 lifecycle hooks injected
# via `claude --settings <json>` on the top-level REPL/print modes.
#
# Why CLI flag instead of CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR overlay?
# Claude derives its macOS keychain service name from
# `sha256(CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR)[:8]` — overriding the env var would shift the
# hash, so OAuth tokens stored in keychain under the real
# `~/.claude` hash become unreachable and the user has to log in again on
# every session. Keeping CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR untouched and injecting hooks
# via a CLI flag preserves login state and shares it with non-mux0 claude.
#
# Why a passthrough blocklist?
# claude's subcommands (`mcp`, `doctor`, `--remote-control`, …) inherit
# commander.js's argument parser, which doesn't always recognize the
# top-level `--settings` flag — `claude remote-control` regressed with
# "Unknown argument: { hooks: …}" (issue #26). Hooks are meaningless for
# those one-shot subcommands anyway, so we passthrough without injection
# whenever any arg matches a known subcommand or help/version flag.
#
# Reads MUX0_AGENT_HOOKS_DIR, MUX0_HOOK_SOCK, MUX0_TERMINAL_ID from env.
