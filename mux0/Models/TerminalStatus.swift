/// - `neverRan`: freshly opened terminal, no agent turn has started yet.
/// - `running`: agent turn is in progress. `detail` optionally carries a live
///   label ("Edit Foo.swift") captured by the tool-start hook.
/// - `idle`: agent has returned control (turn ended, awaiting next prompt).
/// - `needsInput`: agent is awaiting user confirmation before proceeding.
/// - `success` / `failed`: last agent turn's result. `exitCode` is a sentinel —
///   `0` means clean turn, `1` means at least one tool errored. `agent` records
///   which source produced the state; `summary` carries an optional human-readable
///   last-assistant message for tooltip display.

/// State is in-memory only. App restart → all terminals reset to `.neverRan`.
